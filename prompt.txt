The following transcript details a process. Your task is to extract key steps, decision points, and connections to generate a structured flowchart in Pythonâ€™s Graphviz format.

1. Identify each distinct step in the process from the conversation (e.g., "Receive Request," "Verify Information," "Review Decision," etc.).
2. Include decision points (such as Yes/No checks) as diamond-shaped nodes, and label the edges with conditions like "Yes" or "No" where appropriate.
3. Output only the process code using the following format, with each step as a node and connections as edges.
4. To make the graph more compact, use new lines in each node description. The newline should be "\\n", not "\n". Aim for 20 symbols per line.
5. Output the graph in this exact format: """
dot = graphviz.Digraph()
dot.node("A", "Verify Invoice Legitimacy")
dot.node("B", "Is Invoice Legitimate?", shape="diamond")
dot.node("C", "Contact Vendor for Verification")
dot.node("D", "Flag for Further Review")
dot.edge("A", "B")
dot.edge("B", "C", label="No")
dot.edge("B", "D", label="Yes")
dot.edge("C", "A")
"""
